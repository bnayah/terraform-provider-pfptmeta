# Data Source (pfptmeta_tenant_restriction)

Tenant restrictions are used to control access to SaaS cloud applications, such as Office 365. This is done to prevent unwarranted access to potentially malicious tenants, or the ones that are forbidden from accessing due to risk of data loss. With tenant restrictions, organizations can specify the list of tenants that their users are permitted to access, blocking all other tenants. When tenant restrictions are used, the Web Security proxy inserts a list of permitted tenants into traffic destined for the relevant cloud app, allowing it to perform the enforcement.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pfptmeta_tenant_restriction" "tr" {
  id = "cc-123abc"
}

output "tenant_restriction" {
  value = data.pfptmeta_tenant_restriction.tr
}
```
